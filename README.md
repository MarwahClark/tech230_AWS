### Cloud computing.

cloud computing is the delivery of computing servers, storages and databases etc on remote servers over the internet instead of on the computers hardrive or local server. Cloud computing offers faster innovation and change as well as flexible resources.

cloud computing can also be referred to as `internet based computing`

### history of cloud computing
cloud computing dates back to the 1950's, largescale mainframes were installed in schools and cooperations in what was known as a `server room`. organizations were unable to afford the cost of buying and maintain these `server rooms`, they came up with the idea that in order for business' to get a better return on their investments they would allow multiple users to share access to the same data storage layer and CPU power from any station.

in 1970, IBM released the system also known as VM which allowed systems to have more than one virtual machines on a single physical system. it took the shared access of mainframes to the next level as it allowed multple computing environments to live in the same physical environment. This was knwon as `virtualization`. virtualization became a huge catalsyt for some of the biggest evolutions in computing.

in 1990 telecommunications companies began to offer virtualized private network connectitons with the same service of quality but at a cheaper cost. telecommunications allowed their customers to shift traffic as neccesary by allowing them to have shared acces to the same physical infrasturcture using VMs.

As the internet became moree accessible, the next step was to move virtalization online. This was done by allowing servers to be virtualized into shared hosting environments, private servers and virtual dedicated derves.

The cost of servers slowly started to decrease and therefore there was a bigger emphasis on tying to work out how to combne the multiple servers. this started the basic undestanding of the cloud. 

a piece of software called hypervisor  was configured and would allow an environments entire resources to be accesible in one single physical node. cloud computing environments allowd resources to add to the "cloud" easily.


### benefits of the cloud

- *cost* using the cloud allowed businesss+' to optimize IT costs while still delivering the same services. this is because you wouldnt need to buy hardware, software etc.
- *speed* cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, meaning that resources can be provisioned in a number of minutes. this allowed business' to have a lot more flexibilitty and reduce the pressure of capacity planning.
- *productivity* cloud computing removes the need for tasks such as software patching and other time consuming IT management chores. therefore IT teams can spend more time on achieving more important goals
- *reliability* cloud computing makes backing up data easier and simpler as it is less expensive and can be mirrored at different redundant sites on the cloud
- *security* the cloud offers a set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.
- *accesibility* youre able to access the cloud anywhere with any device, this means that employees and employers everywhere have access to the same up to date information anywhere.
- *availability* Cloud services also offer high availability with no downtime because theyâ€™re distributed across multiple cloud facilities. Cloud providers are responsible for updating cloud systems and fixing bugs and security issues in cloud software, which is transparent to end users.
- *quick application deployment* cloud application developments can be improved by quickly deploying cloud apps when they are readily available without having to wait for more hardware or for IT staff to set up servers.
- *virtualized computing* Cloud computing is perfect for virtualized computer environments because cloud resources can be allocated instantly to support significant increases in demand so you never experience downtime again

### AWS
AWS is also known as amazon web servuce, it has adopted cloud, porviding on demand cloud computing platforms to users, companies and governments via a paid subscription and offers fully featured services from data centers globally.

### history of AWS

amazon company wanted to create an e-commerce service called merchant.com to help third party merchants such as target etc. they soon realised that external developmemt platform they were trying to build didnt plan well for future requirements, and instead of having an organized development environment they had created a jumbled mess. it became increasingly hard to seperate the various services in order to make a centralized development platform which could be useful for third parties. this is when the company took the first steps towards building the aws business by untangling the mess into a set of well documented API's. they were still finding that applications still werent being built fast enough where they wanted a project to be built in 3 months it was taking 3 months to build the database, comput or storage components. they then decided to build the inital idea of AWS in the summer of 2003. they realised they could contriubute all the key components required to run the internet OS was yet to be built and by contributing all the key components of that  internetrnet operating systems to create AWS.

### other main cloud service providers.
-azure 
-hostgator
- cloudways
- bluehost
- AWS

### IAAS
IAAS also known as infrastructure as a service, this is where you rent an IT infrastructure from a cloud provider which gives you on demand availability of highly scalable computing resources as services over the initernet on a pay as you go/use basis.

### SAAS
SAAS also known as software as a service, this is where software appliactions are delivered over the internet on demand and typically on a subscription basis. SAAS allows cloud providers to host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure while handling any maintenance for example software upgrades and security patching. users connect via the internet typically over the internet and usually with a web browser on phones tablets and/ or pc.

### PAAS
PAAS also knwon as platform  as a service is when cloud computing services that supply an on demand environment for developing testing, delivering and manging software applicatiuons. it is designed to make it eaier for developers to quikly create web/ mobile apps without worrying abouot setting and managing the underlying infrastructure of servers ,storage, network and databases that would be needed for development.

### public cloud, hybrid cloud and private cloud.
 - public clouds are owned and operated by third party cloud service providers, which deliver computing resources for example servers and storage over the internet. for examlpe microsoft azure and AWS. public clouds allow all hardware, software and other supporting infrastruture to be owned and managed by the cloud provider. they can be accesed using a web browser.![image](https://github.com/MarwahClark/tech230_AWS/assets/133018482/ef2e4518-76d6-488b-8f8b-d8ebcd7869d7)


-private clouds refer to cloud computing resources that are used exclusivly by a single busness of organization. they can be physically located on the company's onsite datacenter. the infrastructure and services are maintained on a private network. for example azure private cloud ![image](https://github.com/MarwahClark/tech230_AWS/assets/133018482/d264eda7-a7da-4901-af20-62371c0751c5)


- hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. they allow data and applications to move between private and public, meaning that business have greater flexibility and more deployment options, for example the healthcare industry.
